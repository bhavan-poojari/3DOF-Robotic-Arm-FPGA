## Abstract
This project presents the design and implementation of a 3-Degree-of-Freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm with a gripper, controlled using an FPGA. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals are generated by the FPGA to precisely control servo motors corresponding to each joint and the gripper. The system demonstrates accurate position control, parallel processing capability, and real-time performance, highlighting the suitability of FPGA-based control for robotic applications.

## Introduction
Robotic arms are widely used in industrial automation, medical systems, pick-and-place operations, and research applications. Traditional microcontroller-based systems are limited by sequential processing and timing constraints. FPGAs offer high-speed parallel processing, deterministic timing, and reconfigurability, making them ideal for real-time motor control applications.

This project focuses on designing a 3-DOF robotic arm with a gripper, where all servo motors are controlled using PWM signals generated by an FPGA.
